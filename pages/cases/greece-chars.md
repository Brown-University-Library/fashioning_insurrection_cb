When the first Greek insurrections against the Ottoman
Empire broke out in 1814, their proponents did not aim
to create the modern notion of a nation-state, but
rather a revival of the Byzantine Empire. Travelers
from western Europe had a significant role in
projecting Hellenic ideals of the ancient past onto
this movement. These travelers further used the art of
costume studies and portraiture to isolate Greek and
Turkish identities into neat taxonomies. The resulting
works cast them as fundamentally opposed ethnicities
despite their entangled histories in this diverse
cultural landscape, which also included Jews,
Albanians, and Armenian Christiansâ€“to name a few. This
visual imagery circulated to further propel a more
reductionist philhellenic movement and inspire
patriotic costumes donned by supporters abroad.
