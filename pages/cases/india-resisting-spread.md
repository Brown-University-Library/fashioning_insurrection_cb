By the late eighteenth century, the faltering Mughal
Empire created a power vacuum in South Asia that
ignited outbreaks of civil war among regional
potentates vying for control, including Awadh in
northern India and Mysore to the south. American
publications, like Bartholomew Burges’ A Series of
Indoﬆan Letters (1790) relate that the British East
India Company leveraged the situation to seize power
in the region, thus transforming from a commercial
enterprise into a colonial one. Yet the British could
not entice sufficient numbers of Europeans to fight as
they expanded. Instead, they turned to the military
labor market in India, hiring local mercenaries as
soldiers, or sepoys (from Persian sipahi, or
“cavalrymen’), to fight their own countrymen.
Travelers and those watching events unfolding from
abroad would closely note the uniforms used to
demarcate sepoys from the countrymen they fought, and
eagerly adapt the regional dress and accoutrements of
resisting Indian principalities as the latest
exoticizing fashions.
