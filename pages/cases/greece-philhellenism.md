Costume permeated the international discourse
regarding the Greek War of Independence, particularly
in America. Although the U.S. government refused to
become directly involved in the Greek struggle,
Americans volunteered to fight alongside Greek rebels.
Those supporters who remained at home took it upon
themselves to raise funds and awareness about the
revolution. The most memorable way they found to
embody their solidarity was to wear Greek folk dress
for portraits and costume balls. National garb also
marked one way that the new Bavarian ruler of Greece
unsuccessfully attempted to relate to his new
subjects. Greek costumes also became distinguishing
elements in the polarizing satirical cartoons and
propaganda that circulated through regions and states
during the conflict.
