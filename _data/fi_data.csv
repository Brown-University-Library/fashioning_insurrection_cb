Dupré continued to Constantinople and Bucharest at the invitation of Prince Michael Soutsos of Moldavia (1784–1864), Great Dragoman of the Sublime Porte and a Phanariot Greek. Dupré recorded his experiences in portraits and costume studies, alongside drawings of antique monuments. Between 1824 and 1837, he published his drawings in a luxurious volume as forty chromolithographs, including visual celebrations of the Greek resistance that enjoyed reprints as far as the U.S. This portrait depicts patriot Nicolacki Mitropolos at the battle in Salona (modern-day Croatia) on Easter in 1821.

Possibly intended for a book, each hand-colored figure appears captured in action on a black-and-white background. Lithography held a special place among artists as the print technology that could capture strokes akin to the handmade movements of a pen or brush. The technology facilitated reproduction in multiples, which helped to quickly disseminate images of revolution to a wide array of consumers. The process required drawing upon a chemically treated stone with fat, wax, or a greasy crayon. The stone was then bathed in acid to etch the ungreased areas, allowing them to retain water when moistened. The greased areas would repel water but cling to ink, thus transferring designs to paper when pressed. Once the print had dried, the printer, colorist, or owner could add hand-colored pigments to accentuate costume details of the figure.\n",,"George Bayly (attr. artist, 1808–88)

Its distinctive tones derived from tiny pits (rather than lines) in the metal plate, which held ink in darker areas, and were scraped smooth or burnished for brighter areas, giving the prints subtle gradations of light and shade. Printers could produce mezzotints more rapidly and cheaply than line engravings. Therefore, mezzotint became a favorite means to quickly disseminate timely images like recent battles and popular costume studies. Until the mid-nineteenth century, mezzotints acted as early forerunners of the photographic newspaper image. Printer Johann Lorenz Rugendas II became known in his earlier work on the Napoleonic Wars (1803–15) for enlisting local artists in an effort to render the most authentic scenes possible before transferring them into mezzotints. To create this print of the storming of Salona, either the printer or his agents similarly recorded decisive battles from the Greek War of Independence as eye-witnesses.",,"Johann Lorenz Rugendas II (artist, 1775–1826)

His reputation of resistance even inspired commemorative pieces of music, including this eponymous quadrille. By this period, this genre of music often accompanied groups of four couples dancing in a square formation at balls and clubs. However, quadrilles originated in the seventeenth century as military parades wherein four mounted horsemen demonstrated square formations. Fittingly, the cover to this quadrille’s sheet music offers a nod to that past by portraying Abd el-Kader, sword in hand, dashing on horseback to join a battle against the French. Minasi, the composer of this sheet music, was a London-born son of an Italian immigrant. He composed over forty albums of music for the concertina and published over forty tutors for students of the concertina and various other instruments, which range from martial themes to women’s daily lives.",,"Carlo Minasi (composer, 1817–91)

Abd el-Kader was at last released from his detention in France on October 16, 1852. Napoleon III welcomed him to Paris, greeting him with all the pomp befitting a head of state and a worthy adversary of the French. This purely propagandistic gesture occurred at the Opéra’s performance of Rossini’s Mosé in Egitto (Moses in Egypt), where Napoleon hailed Abd el-Kader as the “Vercingétorix algérien,” comparing him to the Gaulish leader who capitulated to Caesar and became a symbol of a poetic primitive past in French folklore.",,"Ange-Louis Janet (aka Janet-Lange) (artist, 1815–72)

6-1,6.1,6,57026,AkbarII_01md.webp,State Procession of Emperor Akbar II,"By the late eighteenth century, the Mughal emperor acted as a nominal dispenser of legitimacy rather than a governing authority in northern India. Smaller principalities capitalized on this breakdown in centralization to seize control throughout Mughal lands. Likewise, the emperor no longer appointed his regional subordinates, only confirming those who could subdue his rivals. This fraught political landscape allowed the British East India Company (BEIC) to become the dominant political and military actor in mid-nineteenth-century India. That shift materializes in later Mughal painting, such as this scroll in which the visual hierarchy reflects the latest power dynamics. Close behind the elephant carriage (howdah) of Emperor Akbar II (r. 1806–1837), an even taller howdah bears representatives of the BEIC juxtaposed in European dress. That prominent placement befits the growing British role in Indian political life. By this point, the BEIC collected taxes from Delhi and maintained military forces there. In return, the Mughal emperor maintained some acknowledgement from the BEIC, which provided him a pension.\n",,"Unknown Workshop, Mughal Empire

Wajid Ali Shah inherited a throne virtually bereft of political power. In 1856, two days before the ninth anniversary of his coronation, the BEIC fully annexed Awadh. The nawab was exiled to Kolkata with a generous pension. Major-General Sir James L. Sleeman, the “famous suppressor of Thuggee” (Indian cults of professional robbers and murderers) sent this sixteen-foot-long scroll to England in 1850.

This commercial album, likely once owned by BEIC associate William Jenkins, features a battle scene that mirrors verses in Gīt Bharatpur rau, the Rajastanti martial epic recounting this siege. In this painting, Maratha horsemen charge against the heavy gunfire and artillery of British forces as defensive cannons from the fort fire down on the encroaching British lines. Meanwhile, the royals enjoy a dance performance at the heart of an elaborate garden palace constructed in the Mughal mode. Fire from the Jat defenders rained so fiercely that the British eventually abandoned the siege, but they succeeded in capturing Bharatpur in their second siege in 1825.",,"Ram Dutta (attr. artist)

He resisted imperial forces until his death battling British troops on May 4, 1799, during the Siege of Seringapatam, when the BEIC besieged Tipu's French-allied capital during the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War (1798–99). This plate, likely from a book, reframes Singleton’s original painting with the figures of an Indian soldier in the left margin and a British officer in the right margin, crediting the painter and printer below the figures. Perhaps humorously, the printer has assumed the role of the British officer, as if alluding to how their printed version of the image has superseded the original painting. The bottom vignette references another scene painted by Singleton that illustrates the surrender of Tipu Sultan’s two sons as hostages to General Sir David Baird (1757–1829).",,"Henry Singleton (artist, 1766–1839)

Tipu Sultan and his father, Hyder Ali, gained renown during their lifetimes for expanding the use of the iron-cased Mysorean rockets in their wars against the BEIC. His reputation as a pioneer of rocket artillery lived on past his rule. This broadside credits him with inventing signal rockets with “brilliant reflecting light,” which headlined a fireworks display orchestrated by Isaac Edge Jr. (1801–59) for the Uniformed Militia at Camp Seymour in East Hartford, Connecticut, on October 20, 1847. Replete with exoticizing allusions, the names of fireworks reference key elements of orientalist imaginaries through the foreign origins (both real and spurious) of each pyrotechnic, including the “Indian Palmetto” and “Persian Rose” fireworks, both composed of “Chinese gerbs, which produced fountains or jets of sparks.",,"Letterpress print

Two regions at the heart of this exhibit take a prime spot in this installment’s reporting: American naval prowess in North Africa against Barbary States, as well as the “British fight against Mahrattas and Hindoos” who opposed the spread of the BEIC. Concerning the latter event in particular, the author laments, “On foreign lands we will no longer roam; Well pleas’d, to view our happier state at home.” Not only did these imperial conflicts interrupt American travel but exorbitant protective tariffs and the rise in cotton textile manufacturers in the United States and Europe also caused a decline in India trade. However, luxury imports from India, such as Kashmir shawls and raw materials like indigo, animal hides and saltpeter, continued to remain valuable commodities in the United States into the mid-nineteenth century.",,"Letterpress print

Their costume also distinguished them from the established norms of social hierarchy in Indic societies. This painting of a crowded boat crossing a body of water captures that contrast. The sepoy’s tailored red coat with green collar and cuffs topped with a black tricorn hat immediately stands out against the white and neutral tones of the Hindu men around him. Rather than identifying caste by the markings on their forehead, the sepoy’s entire ensemble indicates that he is operating within the sartorial system of a colonizing power. Even the colorful Mughal outfit on the man at the far left featuring blue spotted robes (jama) topped with a red-and-yellow turban (pagri) bears closer structural similarities to the clothing of the other Indic men around him in regional dress than to the sepoy.",,"Unknown Tajore artist/workshop, British East India

These hired Indian troops bolstered BEIC armies as British soldiers struggled to acclimate to the hot climates of India. While praising their bravery and hardiness, the article also addresses one key issue leading to their dissent: As sepoy officers rose in the ranks, they still remained tied to their familial associations and customs, including religious and/or caste dynamics, which led to divisions between them and their non-Indian subordinates. The accompanying illustrations further juxtapose the demeanor of disciplined sepoy officers against their civilian brethren, reflecting the American author’s admiration of colonial training. Above, Indian civilians passively watch as British cavalrymen cross the Ganges at Allahabad.

In 1837, he succeeded his father, Akbar II, who is featured in the processional scroll in the facing case. Though he held the title of emperor, the Mughal Empire survived in name only, as his authority was reduced to the walled city of Old Delhi (Shahjahanabad), hence he acquired the sobriquet “King of Delhi” among foreigners. He held his first formal audience in years on May 12, 1857, with regiments of rebelling sepoys. When they executed fifty-two European prisoners in the palace on May 16, the implicated ruler relented to their demands and backed their bid to install him as emperor of all India. Following the Siege of Delhi, BEIC forces surrounded the tomb of the emperor’s forefather (Humayun) on the outskirts of Delhi and captured Bahadur Shah on September 20.

This social structure resonated with American merchants who faced mounting racial tensions over the slavery of Black peoples at home. American clergyman and abolitionist William Adam highlighted these comparisons in letters published in 1840, shortly before Boston East Indian merchants arranged his appointment as Professor of Oriental Linguistics at Harvard. Adam warned of British complacency. Even though the British Empire had ended slavery in the West Indies, slavery and racial inequities in India remained unchanged. American traveler Bayard Tayor writes in A Visit to India (1862), “Why is it that the virtue of Exeter Hall and Stafford House can tolerate this without a blush, yet condemn, with pharisaic zeal, the social inequality of the negro and white races in America?”",,"William Adam (author, 1796–1881)

After the conflict, the British dead were buried in a trench, but Indian corpses were left to rot. Italian-British photographer Felice Beato likely captured this image shortly after the city’s evacuation and recapture in March 1858. One contemporary commentator noted, “A few of their [sepoy] bones and skulls are to be seen in front of the picture, but when I saw them every one was being regularly buried, so I presume the dogs dug them up.” The memoirs of British officer Sir George Campbell stated that Beato probably had the bones uncovered to be photographed. However, William Howard Russell of The Times recorded seeing many skeletons still lying around in April 1858. This discrepancy in the sources raises many questions regarding the photo’s staged elements and whether the individuals in this image were bystanders or helpers in Beato’s endeavor.\n",,"Felice Beato (photographer, 1832–1909)\nAlbumen photograph\nAlbum of Lucknow after the Indian Mutiny, 1858

7-6,7.6,7,57037,carriers_address.webp,“Carrier's Address to the Patrons of the Armstrong Democrat”,"This broadside condemns the actions of sepoys in the 1857 Indian Uprising. The verse sensationalizes civilian casualties by invoking orientalist tropes that dubbed the sepoys “butchers of helpless women, girls, and boys” who were “drunk with the blood of Christian martyrs.” It references documented murders of British civilians and officers, like the massacre of British prisoners by Nana Sahib at Kanpur in July 1857. The language here echoes the anti-Christian and Islamophobic rhetoric from the earlier Greek War of Independence. Yet the human suffering of this uprising proved immense across the board. The British devastated the great cities of Delhi and Lucknow, also burning countryside villages that resisted in Awadh. The authors simultaneously call for mercy from Britain while supporting their violent vengeance toward imperial insurrection. Such militant popular support for Britain in this uprising illustrates shifting American sentiments toward rebellion and may reflect growing expansionist ambitions of the United States.",,"Letterpress print

Historically, it served as lantern- and windowpanes or as a cheaper substitute for colored glass in processional structures during the Muslim month of Muharram. Indian artists also produced mica paintings for foreign buyers, including BEIC employees who considered such works more as exotic novelties than art objects. Letters from travelers relate that mica paintings were commonly sold at riverside markets in ready-made packets of six or twelve, called firqa. Many of these easily transported mica paintings showcased sartorial distinctions of rank, documenting the Indian caste system through a variety of character types, trades, ceremonies, processions, and scenes of daily life.

The husband wears the uniform of a sepoy private of Madras Native Infantry. His forehead bears a distinctive Hindu marking known as a tilak (pl. tilaka) in white, made from chalk, rice powder, and other materials depending on the individual’s religious beliefs. In 1806, the British Madras Army offended both Hindu and Muslim soldiers when it banned the wearing of tilaka and required Muslim soldiers to shave their beards. The resulting uprising at Vellore that year demonstrated that the BEIC needed to respect the customs of its men, and the new regulations were abolished.

The accessories rapidly spread across Europe and America after Napoleon’s expedition into Egypt in 1798–99, after officers brought home samples of imported Indian shawls worn in this Ottoman territory. These shawls arrived in America on New England trade ships coming from Ottoman Smyrna and beyond. Though India trade diminished somewhat in the nineteenth century, Godey’s Lady’s Book (May 1858) still featured luxury Indian shawls, estimating that an authentic full-size shawl cost from $500 to $5,000, with heavy customs duties. Many combine embroidery, loomwork, and sections of needlework carefully arranged in patterns sewn together. These shawls were frequently associated with rajahs and sultans in women’s periodicals throughout the Indian Uprising of 1857–58, and these world events seemed to enhance their exotic appeal.
