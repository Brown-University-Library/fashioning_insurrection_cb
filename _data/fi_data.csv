Until April 1820, they traveled through Corfu, Epirus, Thessaly, Central Greece, Attica, and the Saronic Islands. Dupré continued to Constantinople and Bucharest at the invitation of Prince Michael Soutsos of Moldavia (1784–1864), Great Dragoman of the Sublime Porte and a Phanariot Greek. Dupré recorded his experiences in portraits and costume studies, alongside drawings of antique monuments. Between 1824 and 1837, he published his drawings in a luxurious volume as forty chromolithographs, including visual celebrations of the Greek resistance that enjoyed reprints as far as the U.S. This portrait depicts patriot Nicolacki Mitropolos at the battle in Salona (modern-day Croatia) on Easter in 1821. The hero dramatically tramples an Ottoman while raising his flag.",baz,"Louis Dupré (draughtsman, 1789–1837)

The figure with a trim mustache on the right appears relaxed and unarmed while smoking a long opium pipe. A caption identifies the figure on the left as Nikitas (Nikitaras) Stamatelopoulos (c. 1784–1849), who gained renown as a leader after his victory at the Battle of Dervenakia (1822) and later engagements under the sobriquet Turkofaghos (Greek for “Turk-eater”). Fittingly, he stands ready for battle with his sword in hand and guns tucked into an embroidered sash. His fur kaftan further distinguishes him as a local notable of status, though he maintained a documented reputation of indifference to wealth. Following the war, his opposition to the new Bavarian Regency of Greece landed him in jail.",baz,"Artist(s) now unknown (European in Greece or Ottoman Empire)

Though often sold as individual stock figures, collectively these albums made bespoke portraits of the empire, as the organization of each collection could differ drastically based on the consumer. The albums perused by armchair travelers further popularized ethnic and regional costume far beyond the bounds of the empire. Frequently copied into prints and adapted into European and American fashions by the nineteenth century, such images fueled turquerie soirées of elites, inspired the Turkish trousers of suffragettes, and allowed political supporters of the Greek Revolution to dress the part in solidarity. Paintings from this album offer characters from all sides of this conflict, such as a Balkan cavalryman in decorative russet jacket and pantaloons bearing a scimitar, a klepht (Greek) soldier, and an Ottoman janissary officer known as a çorbacı.",baz,"Artist(s) now unknown (Greece or Ottoman Empire)

Possibly intended for a book, each hand-colored figure appears captured in action on a black-and-white background. Lithography held a special place among artists as the print technology that could capture strokes akin to the handmade movements of a pen or brush. The technology facilitated reproduction in multiples, which helped to quickly disseminate images of revolution to a wide array of consumers. The process required drawing upon a chemically treated stone with fat, wax, or a greasy crayon. The stone was then bathed in acid to etch the ungreased areas, allowing them to retain water when moistened. The greased areas would repel water but cling to ink, thus transferring designs to paper when pressed. Once the print had dried, the printer, colorist, or owner could add hand-colored pigments to accentuate costume details of the figure.",baz,"George Bayly (attr. artist, 1808–88)

Its distinctive tones derived from tiny pits (rather than lines) in the metal plate, which held ink in darker areas, and were scraped smooth or burnished for brighter areas, giving the prints subtle gradations of light and shade. Printers could produce mezzotints more rapidly and cheaply than line engravings. Therefore, mezzotint became a favorite means to quickly disseminate timely images like recent battles and popular costume studies. Until the mid-nineteenth century, mezzotints acted as early forerunners of the photographic newspaper image. Printer Johann Lorenz Rugendas II became known in his earlier work on the Napoleonic Wars (1803–15) for enlisting local artists in an effort to render the most authentic scenes possible before transferring them into mezzotints. To create this print of the storming of Salona, either the printer or his agents similarly recorded decisive battles from the Greek War of Independence as eye-witnesses.",baz,"Johann Lorenz Rugendas II (artist, 1775–1826)
