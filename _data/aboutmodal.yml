  Americans have adapted uniforms into costumes since
  the masquerade balls of colonial days to today’s
  historical films and battle reenactments. The practice
  took an unexpected form in the first decades following
  the American Revolution when the early presses of the
  United States closely covered imperial insurrections
  that unfolded across Islamicate societies against the
  three towering empires of the era: the Greek War of
  Independence against the Ottomans (1821–29), the
  Ottoman Algerian resistance to the French (1830–48),
  and the Indian uprising against the British (1857).
  Alongside depictions of these struggles, American
  popular media paid careful attention to the
  “national” dress and military uniforms that could
  potentially unify a revolution or even aid in
  controlling insurrection. As the young nation
  navigated its connections to the Islamicate world,
  some reinterpreted visual and sartorial modes of
  imperial resistance. The reverberations of these
  events led to the emergence of orientalist costumes
  and dress that transformed regional revolutionary
  garb into American fashion statements of solidarity,
  fascination, and emulation.

  Through these forms of cosmopolitan materialism,
  Americans announced their political stances on
  historic movements, sometimes also asserting their
  country’s imperial ambitions and legacies as it
  solidified its standing in the world. Such sartorial
  translations from uniforms to fashion informed
  America’s evolving relationship with its own
  revolutionary past. Each medium these costumes
  inhabited aided Americans in creatively redefining
  their country’s transforming identity on the
  international stage while facing resonant issues in
  their new nation, including foreign trade, slavery,
  and humanitarianism. Alongside contextualizing
  documents, the works here vividly illustrate how the
  U.S. wielded these movements of imperial
  insurrection to remold its own world image and don
  it with aplomb.
